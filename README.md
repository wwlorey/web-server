# Programming assignment 1 (pa01)

1. Complete the WebServer.pdf activity, including the two optional activities at the end.
Name your python server `WebServer.py` and the client `client.py`.

2. Complete the ProxyServer.pdf activity; you can skip the optional parts on this one.
Name your proxy server `ProxyServer.py`.

For both parts, include the source code and screenshots (in png format) as instructed in each PDF.

General:
* Everything should be in python3.
* It should run in an up-to-date kali VM.
* All source and text files should be utf-8 with Unix delimiters.
* Include a python shebang and make your source files executable, so they can be run like: `./yoursource.py`.

Notes: parts of the distributed code are python2, and thus need updating to work.
